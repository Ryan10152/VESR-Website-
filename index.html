    <p>What are values?</p>
    <p>Values are beliefs or principles that a person considers important that drive their behavior and actions.</p>

    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Even if everyone's values are different, we all have values. They reflect what is important to us and shape our character both as individuals and as a community.</p>

   <p>This site explores some of my fundamental values that I hold dear.</p>

    <div class="value">
      <h3>Integrity</h3>
      <p>Integrity means being honest, consistent, and true to my values, even when no one is watching. It is important because it builds trust with others and strengthens your relationships. Integrity grants you self-respect, since you donâ€™t have to carry guilt or hide your actions. Without it, people may lose confidence in you, and opportunities could be harder to earn. Living with integrity helps me feel stable, respected, and proud of who I am.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value">
      <h3>Community</h3>
      <p>Community is one of my most important values; it is usually described as supporting, respecting, and working together with others toward a common good. It creates a sense of belonging within me where I feel connected, valued, and encouraged to grow. When people practice community, we build stronger relationships and create an environment where everyone can succeed. Without it, people may feel isolated, unsupported, or divided, which weakens trust and teamwork. A lack of community can lead to conflict and make it harder for groups to reach shared goals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value">
      <h3>Determination</h3>
      <p>I'd say determination is being able to stay focused and persistent in working toward my goals, even when challenges arise. It pushes me to keep trying, learn from mistakes, and not give up easily. With determination, you build resilience and confidence, which helps you achieve success. Without it, you may give up too quickly, miss opportunities, and struggle to reach your full potential. Not feeling motivated or being determined can leave you feeling stuck when obstacles appear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="value">
      <h3>Humor</h3>
      <p>I'd say this is a more important core value than people may think. Humor can be used in many strategical ways in both the professional and personal settings. Humor is used as relief in stressful situations, it can make subordinates more comfortable, and make you more likeable overall. Lacking humor can result in a struggle of connecting with people and fitting in.</p>
